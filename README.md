# IndyObfuscator
This is a small project that obfuscates method calls by replacing them with InvokeDynamic instructions.

## Disclaimer
Besides that the obfuscator is open-source, the decryption of the inserted InvokeDynamic instructions is pretty easy.
Therefore, it is not recommended using this in production.
